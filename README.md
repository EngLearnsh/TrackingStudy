# TrackingStudy
Eye-tracking technology is used to assist the completion of "fluctuating speed reading", which greatly improves the reading efficiency.
The user's understanding of the word can be distinguished by calculating how long the eye stays there.
Thus brings the precise auxiliary effect.
Remenber words easier by moving your eyes

## What is it
- Basic eye tracking by calling webcam inside laptop or USB webcam
- Hardware data analyzing by `gaze_tracking.py`
- By giving positions, indicates which word you are currently focusing on and gives you the translation
- Analyze the eye states of different people to bring accurate results.

## Notice
You may need to install some dependencies (Numpy, OpenCV, Dlib etc):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
